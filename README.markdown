Propel Vendor Clone
===================

https://github.com/Xosofox/propelVendor is a compilation of the different dependencies that are currently only available via svn.
It consitst of copies of the 1.5 and 1.6 propel versions from the official SVN repos as well as phing 2.3.3, commited into branches

The intention of these repos is to use them as a git submodule in your project, so you do not need svn.

On Master branch, there might be no files - specifically checkout branch 1.5 or 1.6
